# FrostyToolsuite
The most advanced modding platform for games running on DICE's Frostbite game engine.

## Setup

1. Download Git (this should hopefully be the right software) https://git-scm.com/download/win
2. Create an empty folder, go inside it, right click an empty space and hit "Gt Bash Here". That should open up a command prompt
3. Press green "Code" button. Click that and copy the text under "HTTPS"
4. Type out ``git clone -b 1.0.6 <HTTPS code>`` in the command prompt and hit enter. This should clone the project files
5. Open the project with Visual Studio 2019, and make sure the project is set to ``DeveloperDebug`` and ``x64``.
